## Usage

TODO

## Development

You will need node/yarn installed on your machine.

Installing dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Once you have dependencies installed you can do

```
yarn start
```

This will watch for changes and build the application in the `build` directory.

## Tests

Running tests is easy: 

```
yarn test
```

Or in watch mode:

```
yarn run watch-test
```
